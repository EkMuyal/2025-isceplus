    "\n",
    "#### Strides\n",
    "You can create a downsampled version of the output using `--output-options.strides.x` (or `--sx` for short) and `--sy`. \n",
    "This will save time/space by creation an output with coarser pixel spacing than your SLCs.\n",
    "For COMPASS outputs, adding `--sx 6 --sy 3` will convert the inputs at (5m, 10m) in `(x, y)` (aka `(easting, northing)`) to a (30 meter, 30 meter) output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specify the working directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `--work-directory` to save all rasters to a different directory other than the one you call `dolphin run` from.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specify how many bursts, or patches, to process in parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding the `--n-parallel-bursts`, you can process separate geocoded bursts at the same time (assuming sufficient resources are available). On a large single stack (like the flat binary files from isce2, or NISAR swaths), this option controls the number of parallel blocks to process during phase linking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, use `--threads-per-worker` to limit the number of CPUs you would like the workflow to use, especially on large workstations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mini-stack size for phase linking\n",
    "\n",
    "When processing many (dozens to hundreds) of SLCs, `dolphin` will use the strategy of batching SLCs into \"mini-stacks\", rather than processing the entire stack at once. The default is to use batch of 15 dates at a time, but this can be changed with `--phase-linking.ministack-size` or `--ms`. For example, you may want to try processing all dates at once (likely a slower processing time), or you may want to adjust the number slightly (if, e.g., you have 46 dates and would rather not leave the last batch with one remaining).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase unwrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "`dolphin` supports multiple options for phase unwrapping. Here, we will use the [Python wrapper for SNAPHU](https://github.com/isce-framework/snaphu-py), one of the most widely used phase unwrapping algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bounds subsetting\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in a smaller subset of the area, you can specify the `--output-bounds` to force the raster boundaries."
